## Background on Medicare Advantage and Supplemental Benefits

### Understanding Medicare Advantage

Medicare Advantage, also known as Medicare Part C, offers beneficiaries an alternative to Original Medicare by providing all Part A and Part B benefits through private insurers approved by Medicare. These plans often include additional benefits not covered by Original Medicare, aiming to provide a more comprehensive healthcare solution that addresses a wider range of patient needs. Since its inception in the late 1990s, Medicare Advantage has grown significantly, with enrollment increasing from 5.3 million in 2004 to over 26 million in 2021, representing about 42% of all Medicare beneficiaries (Jacobson et al.).

Medicare Advantage plans are known for their integrated care models, often including networks of providers that coordinate to deliver personalized care. This coordination can lead to improved health outcomes and higher patient satisfaction compared to Original Medicare (Timbie et al.). Additionally, many Medicare Advantage plans offer prescription drug coverage (Part D) and have out-of-pocket spending limits, providing financial protection against high medical costs.

### Importance of Supplemental Benefits

Supplemental benefits are integral to enhancing the overall healthcare experience for Medicare Advantage members. They offer services and items beyond the standard coverage, addressing preventive care, chronic conditions, and quality-of-life improvements. The expansion of supplemental benefits is partly due to policy changes that allow Medicare Advantage plans greater flexibility to address social determinants of health (SDOH) (CMS "Reinterpretation of 'Primarily Health Related'").

Common supplemental benefits include:

- **Over-the-Counter (OTC) Benefits**: Allowing members to access medications and health-related items without prescriptions, promoting preventive care and self-management of minor health issues. For example, members may receive a monthly allowance to purchase items like vitamins, first-aid supplies, and wellness products (Kaiser Family Foundation).

- **Hearing Aids and Transportation Services**: Supporting sensory health and addressing mobility challenges, these benefits improve accessibility to essential healthcare services. Access to hearing aids can significantly improve the quality of life for seniors with hearing loss, while transportation services help overcome barriers to attending medical appointments (Willink and Reed).

- **Special Supplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill (SSBCIs)**: Tailored to individuals with chronic conditions, SSBCIs provide customized support to manage ongoing health challenges effectively. These benefits may include meal delivery, home modifications, and non-medical services that address specific needs (CMS "Improving Medicare Advantage for Patients").

For instance, a member with diabetes might receive nutritional counseling and meal delivery to help manage their condition, reducing the risk of hospitalization (Brown).

### The Role of Supplemental Benefits in Addressing Social Determinants of Health

Supplemental benefits play a crucial role in addressing SDOH, such as food insecurity, housing instability, and social isolation. By offering benefits like meal programs, pest control, and companionship services, Medicare Advantage plans can help mitigate factors that negatively impact health outcomes (Taylor).

## Overview of the 2026 Member Notices

### Purpose and Objectives

The **2026 Member Notices** are a regulatory initiative designed to inform Medicare Advantage members who have not utilized their supplemental benefits about the opportunities and services available to them. The primary objective is to raise awareness and encourage these members to take advantage of benefits that can improve their health outcomes and overall wellbeing. This initiative aligns with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS) commitment to enhance beneficiary engagement and health equity (CMS "2022 Star Ratings").

The notices aim to:

- **Increase Awareness**: Inform members about the range of supplemental benefits available to them, many of which may be unfamiliar or overlooked.

- **Promote Utilization**: Encourage members to use these benefits to support preventive care and manage chronic conditions effectively.

- **Address Barriers**: Identify and mitigate barriers to utilization, such as lack of information, cultural differences, or perceived stigma.

### Target Audience: Members with Zero Utilization

These notices specifically target members who have shown no utilization of their supplemental benefits. By focusing on non-utilizers, the initiative aims to address potential gaps in awareness, understanding, or perceived need that may prevent members from accessing valuable healthcare resources. Studies have shown that lack of awareness is a significant barrier to benefit utilization among Medicare Advantage enrollees (Graham).

For example, a member may be unaware that their plan offers transportation services, leading them to miss medical appointments due to mobility issues. By receiving a personalized notice, the member can become informed and start utilizing this benefit to improve their health outcomes.

### Implementation Strategies

The 2026 Member Notices will employ various strategies to effectively reach and engage the target audience:

- **Personalized Communication**: Tailoring messages to individual members based on their health profiles and specific benefits they are eligible for but have not used.

- **Multilingual and Culturally Sensitive Materials**: Providing notices in multiple languages and formats to accommodate diverse populations, ensuring accessibility and comprehension.

- **Multichannel Delivery**: Utilizing mail, email, texts, and phone calls to maximize reach and cater to different communication preferences.

### Expected Outcomes

By implementing the 2026 Member Notices, Medicare Advantage plans anticipate:

- **Improved Health Outcomes**: Increased utilization of supplemental benefits can lead to better management of health conditions and preventive care.

- **Higher Member Satisfaction**: Enhanced awareness and use of benefits contribute to overall satisfaction with the health plan.

- **Reduction in Healthcare Costs**: Preventive services and effective chronic disease management can reduce hospitalizations and emergency room visits, leading to cost savings (Maeng et al.).

## Eligibility Requirements for Supplemental Benefits

### General Eligibility Criteria

To access supplemental benefits, members must:

- **Be Enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan**: Only those enrolled in Medicare Part C plans that offer supplemental benefits are eligible.

- **Meet Specific Benefit Criteria**: Some benefits, like SSBCIs, may require a diagnosis of a chronic condition or assessment of need.

### Special Supplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill (SSBCIs)

SSBCIs have additional eligibility requirements:

- **Chronic Condition Verification**: Members must have one or more complex chronic conditions that are life-threatening or significantly reduce overall health and function.

- **Plan Assessment**: The Medicare Advantage plan must determine that the benefits are reasonably expected to improve or maintain the health or overall function of the member (CMS "Medicare and You").

## Barriers to Utilization of Supplemental Benefits

Several factors contribute to the underutilization of supplemental benefits:

- **Lack of Awareness**: Members may not know which benefits are available to them.

- **Complex Information**: Overwhelming or confusing plan details can deter members from exploring benefits.

- **Cultural and Language Barriers**: Non-English speakers or culturally diverse populations may face challenges in understanding benefit offerings.

- **Perceived Stigma**: Some members may avoid using certain benefits due to stigma, such as mental health services.

## Strategies to Increase Utilization

To overcome these barriers, Medicare Advantage plans can:

- **Simplify Communication**: Use clear, concise language and provide easy-to-understand materials.

- **Engage Healthcare Providers**: Encourage providers to discuss supplemental benefits during appointments.

- **Leverage Technology**: Utilize mobile apps and online portals to make information readily accessible.

- **Community Outreach**: Partner with community organizations to educate members about available benefits.
