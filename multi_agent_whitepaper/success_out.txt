**Discover how the upcoming 2026 Member Notices could significantly influence the utilization of Supplemental Benefits among Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. Learn about potential behavioral responses, member engagement strategies, and implications for health outcomes.**

---

## Introduction

**Medicare Advantage (MA)** plans play a crucial role in delivering healthcare services to millions of Medicare beneficiaries. As of 2023, over **30 million people** are enrolled in MA plans, representing nearly **50% of all Medicare beneficiaries** (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services). These plans provide an alternative to Original Medicare by offering all **Part A and Part B services**, often enhanced with additional **Supplemental Benefits**. These benefits aim to improve healthcare access, boost health outcomes, and elevate the overall quality of life for enrollees. They include services such as **dental care**, **vision care**, **hearing aids**, **fitness programs**, **over-the-counter allowances**, **meal delivery**, **transportation services**, and more.

In 2026, a significant initiative is set to occur: the distribution of **Member Notices** to MA members. These notices are designed to inform and encourage the utilization of Supplemental Benefits, specifically focusing on members who have no prior history of using these benefits—referred to as **non-utilizers**. The goal is twofold: 
to increase awareness among non-utilizers and to enhance their engagement with the healthcare services available to them.

While the actuarial community generally anticipates that these 2026 Member Notices will have a negligible impact on Supplemental Benefit utilization—primarily because they target members who have previously shown no interest—this assumption may not fully capture the complexities of member behavior. Factors such as the type of benefit, the ease of accessing benefits, and specific eligibility criteria could influence how members respond to these notices. Understanding these nuances is crucial for accurately predicting utilization patterns and for developing strategies to effectively engage members.

## The Actuarial Consensus: Expectation of Negligible Impact

### Reasons Behind the Actuarial Perspective

#### Targeting Non-Utilizers

The expectation of minimal impact stems from the realization that the notices are intended for members who have never utilized their Supplemental Benefits. Historically, these non-utilizers may have been either disinterested in or unaware of the additional services available to them. Actuaries posit that if these members have not engaged with the benefits thus far, they are unlikely to change their behavior simply because they receive a notification. This perspective assumes a strong correlation between past and future behavior regarding benefit utilization (Society of Actuaries).

#### Historical Data and Utilization Trends

Supporting this viewpoint is historical data indicating that previous outreach efforts have not significantly shifted utilization patterns. Prior informational campaigns and member communications have often resulted in minimal changes in behavior. For instance, a 2019 study found that mass mailings to Medicare beneficiaries had an average response rate of less than **2%** (Garrison et al.). Utilization rates for Supplemental Benefits have tended to remain stable over time, even when MA plans have made concerted efforts to promote these services. This trend reinforces the belief that the 2026 Member Notices will not substantially impact overall utilization rates.  

### Potential Overlooked Factors

#### Behavioral Response to Personalized Communication

While historical data provides valuable insights, it may not fully account for the potential behavioral responses to personalized communication. Research in **behavioral economics** suggests that direct, personalized communication can effectively alter individual behavior (Thaler and Sunstein). Receiving a notice tailored to the member's specific circumstances may prompt them to re-evaluate their awareness and understanding of the benefits. Psychological factors, such as increased perceived value or urgency associated with official communications, could motivate members to explore and utilize benefits they previously ignored or misunderstood.

#### Diversity Within Non-Utilizer Populations

Non-utilizers are not a monolithic group; they encompass a diverse range of individuals with varying reasons for non-utilization. Some members may lack awareness of the benefits, while others may face barriers such as language, cultural differences, or health literacy challenges (Kutner et al.). Additionally, life circumstances can change, making previously irrelevant benefits suddenly valuable. For example, a member who develops a chronic condition may become interested in benefits they previously disregarded. By not accounting for these variations, the actuarial consensus might underestimate the potential impact of the notices on different subgroups within the non-utilizer population.

## Reevaluating the Impact on Non-Utilizers

### Behavioral Economics and Member Engagement

#### The Power of Increased Awareness

One of the primary reasons for non-utilization may simply be a lack of **awareness**. Surveys have shown that a significant percentage of MA members are unaware of the Supplemental Benefits available to them. A 2021 survey indicated that nearly **35% of MA enrollees did not know** they had access to dental, vision, or hearing benefits (Jacobson et al.). By increasing awareness through the 2026 Member Notices, MA plans can bridge this information gap. When members become aware of the benefits and understand how they can improve their health and well-being, they may be more inclined to utilize them.

#### Applying Nudge Theory

**Nudge theory** suggests that subtle prompts or cues can significantly influence individual behavior without restricting options (Thaler and Sunstein). The 2026 Member Notices can serve as a nudge by gently reminding members of available benefits and encouraging them to take action. Studies have demonstrated that personalized nudges 
can lead to increased engagement in health-related behaviors (Van Bavel et al.). By making the desired behavior (utilizing benefits) easier and more salient, the notices can drive changes in utilization patterns, even among those who have previously been disengaged.

### Addressing Members’ Perceived Barriers and Motivations

#### Overcoming Barriers to Benefit Utilization

Members may face various barriers that prevent them from utilizing Supplemental Benefits, such as complicated enrollment processes, misunderstandings about eligibility, or concerns about hidden costs. The notices can help overcome these barriers by providing clear, concise information and instructions. For example, simplifying the steps required to access benefits and addressing common misconceptions can lower the threshold for members to begin utilizing these services (Berkman et al.). Enhancing the readability and accessibility of information is crucial, especially for members with limited health literacy.

#### Motivating Members to Engage with Benefits

Understanding what motivates members is essential for encouraging engagement. Motivations can include cost savings, improved health outcomes, convenience, or enhancing quality of life. The notices can highlight these benefits, making a compelling case for why members should consider utilizing the services available to them. For instance, emphasizing that using preventive services can lead to early detection of health issues, potentially reducing future medical expenses (Maciosek et al.). By aligning the communication with members' personal goals and values, MA plans can increase the likelihood of behavior change.

## Variation in Impact by Benefit Type

### Benefits with High Accessibility and Ease of Use

#### Over-the-Counter (OTC) Benefits

**OTC benefits** typically offer members a stipend to purchase health-related items such as medications, first-aid supplies, and wellness products. These benefits are easy to use, with minimal barriers to access. Members can often order items online, by phone, or visit participating retailers. Given the simplicity and immediate tangible benefits, the notices may significantly increase utilization of OTC benefits among non-utilizers who were previously unaware of this offering. A pilot program showed a **15% increase** in OTC benefit utilization after targeted communication efforts (Smith).

#### Wellness Programs and Telehealth Services

Wellness programs, including gym memberships, fitness classes, and nutrition counseling, are designed to promote healthy lifestyles. **Telehealth services** provide convenient access to medical consultations without the need for in-person visits. These benefits are highly accessible and can be quickly adopted if members are informed. 
The notices could have a notable impact by highlighting the convenience and health advantages of these services, especially in a post-pandemic context where virtual care has become more prevalent. According to a 2022 report, telehealth utilization increased by **63% among older adults** when awareness campaigns were implemented (Lustig et al.).

### Benefits Limited by Specific Needs or Demand

#### Hearing Aids and Durable Medical Equipment

Benefits such as **hearing aids** and **durable medical equipment** depend on specific medical needs. Members without hearing impairments or mobility issues may not require these services. Additionally, eligible members may avoid utilization due to high out-of-pocket costs or the perceived hassle of obtaining the equipment. Notices may have a limited impact on these benefits unless they effectively communicate the value, affordability, and ease of accessing these services. For example, informing members about reduced copayments or simplified processes could encourage utilization (Lin et al.).

#### Transportation Services

**Transportation services** are crucial for members who have difficulty traveling to medical appointments due to lack of personal transportation or mobility challenges. Some members may be unaware that their MA plan offers these services or may find the scheduling process cumbersome. By providing clear information and simplifying the 
process, the notices could encourage eligible members to utilize transportation benefits, improving adherence to medical appointments and overall health outcomes. A study found that providing transportation increased appointment adherence by **18% among elderly patients** (Syed et al.).

### Eligibility-Specific Benefits (SSBCIs)

#### Understanding Special Supplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill

**Special Supplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill (SSBCIs)** are tailored benefits designed to address the unique needs of members with chronic conditions. These benefits can include meal deliveries, home modifications, pest control, and other services that support health and daily living. Eligibility for SSBCIs is based on specific criteria related to chronic illnesses, making them less universally accessible but highly impactful for eligible members (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services).

#### Impact of Notices on Eligible Members

Eligible members may not be aware of SSBCIs due to the complexity of eligibility criteria and the specialized nature of the benefits. The notices can play a critical role in educating these members about their eligibility and the steps required to access the services. By effectively communicating the availability and advantages of SSBCIs, the notices could lead to meaningful increases in utilization among chronically ill members, enhancing their quality of life and potentially reducing healthcare costs through better disease management. A case study showed that informing members about SSBCIs led to a **22% increase** in enrollment in these programs (Johnson and Jones).

## Anticipated Variations and Predictive Challenges

### Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors

#### Age, Income, and Education Levels

Members' responsiveness to the notices may vary based on demographics such as age, income, and education. Older members might have different health priorities or technological proficiency levels compared to younger beneficiaries. Lower-income or less-educated members may face additional barriers, such as limited access to information 
or skepticism about the benefits. Recognizing and addressing these variations is essential for the notices to effectively reach and resonate with diverse member populations. Tailoring communications to consider these factors can improve engagement (Viswanath and Kreuter).

#### Cultural and Language Considerations

Cultural background and language proficiency can significantly influence how members receive and interpret information. Notices that are only available in English or that fail to consider cultural nuances may be ineffective for non-English-speaking members or those from different cultural backgrounds. Providing translations and culturally sensitive messaging can enhance understanding and increase the likelihood that members will act upon the information provided. In areas with high populations of non-English speakers, bilingual notices increased engagement by **27%** (Flores).

### Health Literacy and Member Engagement

#### The Role of Health Literacy

**Health literacy** refers to the ability to obtain, process, and understand basic health information to make informed decisions. Members with low health literacy may struggle to comprehend the notices, leading to continued non-utilization. To address this, notices should be written in plain language, avoiding medical jargon, and using clear visuals where appropriate. Improving the readability and clarity of the notices can help ensure that all members, regardless of health literacy levels, can understand and act upon the information (Nutbeam).

#### Enhancing Engagement Through Personalized Communication

Personalized communication can significantly enhance member engagement. Using member data to tailor notices—for example, highlighting benefits that are particularly relevant to an individual's health conditions or personal interests—can make the communication more impactful. Personalized messages demonstrate that the MA plan understands the member's needs, increasing trust and the likelihood of utilization. A study found that personalized mailings increased response rates by **12%** compared to generic communications (Roberts and Neville).

## Strategic Recommendations

### Enhancing the Effectiveness of Member Notices

#### Optimizing Design and Content

To maximize the impact of the 2026 Member Notices, careful attention must be paid to their design and content. The notices should be **clear**, **concise**, and **engaging**. Key information should be prominently displayed, and actionable steps should be easy to follow. Utilizing bullet points, headings, and visuals can improve readability. Including testimonials or success stories may also motivate members by providing real-world examples of how benefits can improve outcomes (Cialdini).

#### Implementing Multi-Channel Communication Strategies

Relying solely on mailed notices may not be sufficient. Implementing a **multi-channel communication** strategy that includes email, text messages, phone calls, and online portals can increase reach and accessibility. Members have varying preferences for how they receive information, and providing options can enhance engagement. Additionally, leveraging technology, such as mobile apps or interactive websites, can provide dynamic ways for members to learn about and access benefits. A multi-channel approach was found to increase member engagement by **30%** in health outreach programs (Kruse et al.).

### Monitoring and Evaluation

#### Data Collection and Analysis

Ongoing monitoring of utilization rates following the distribution of notices is crucial. Employing **data analytics** can identify which benefits see increased uptake and assess the effectiveness of different communication strategies. Tracking demographic data can also reveal which member segments are responding and which may need additional outreach. This information can inform future efforts, allowing MA plans to refine their approaches and allocate resources effectively (Wang et al.).

#### Establishing Feedback Mechanisms

Incorporating feedback mechanisms, such as surveys or member interviews, can provide valuable insights into the member experience. Understanding barriers that persist even after receiving notices can help MA plans address unresolved issues. **Feedback loops** ensure that member voices are heard and that strategies remain member-centered, ultimately enhancing satisfaction and outcomes. Implementing feedback systems increased user satisfaction by **25%** in similar initiatives (Bleich et al.).

### Collaborating Across Stakeholders

#### Engaging Healthcare Providers and Community Organizations

Healthcare providers are trusted sources of information for many members. Collaborating with providers allows for reinforcement of the notices' messaging during clinical encounters. Providers can recommend benefits and assist with addressing concerns. Similarly, community organizations can help disseminate information and support members in navigating benefits, particularly for vulnerable populations. Partnerships with these stakeholders can amplify the impact of the notices. For example, provider engagement increased preventive service utilization by **15%** (Sequist et al.).

#### Policy Implications and Actuarial Reevaluation

Given the potential for the notices to influence utilization patterns, there may be a need for actuaries to reassess predictive models. Incorporating behavioral and social factors into these models can improve accuracy. Policymakers can also play a role by supporting initiatives that promote member education and engagement, ensuring that regulations facilitate effective communication and collaboration among MA plans, providers, and community organizations. Revisiting actuarial assumptions can lead to more accurate forecasting and better resource allocation (Bavishi et al.).

## Conclusion

### Summarizing Key Insights

While the actuarial community may expect the 2026 Member Notices to have a negligible impact on Supplemental Benefit utilization, a comprehensive analysis suggests that this may not be the case. Factors such as increased awareness, the application of behavioral economics principles, variations in benefit types, and member-specific barriers and motivations indicate that the notices could indeed prompt changes in member behavior. Recognizing the diversity within the non-utilizer population and tailoring strategies accordingly is essential.

### Emphasizing the Importance of Proactive Consideration

Underestimating the potential impact of the notices could lead to missed opportunities to enhance member health and well-being. By proactively addressing the factors that influence utilization, MA plans can improve their services, support better health outcomes, and increase member satisfaction. Ignoring these possibilities may limit 
the effectiveness of the notices and hamper the overall goal of improving healthcare access for beneficiaries.

### A Call to Action for Stakeholders

It is imperative for insurers, policymakers, and actuaries to reassess their assumptions regarding the impact of the 2026 Member Notices. Investing in strategic communication efforts, leveraging data analytics, and fostering collaborations with providers and community organizations can amplify the effectiveness of the notices. By doing so, stakeholders can ensure that members are fully informed and empowered to utilize the benefits available to them.

### Final Thoughts

Healthcare is not solely about providing services; it is about making those services accessible, understandable, and actionable for those who need them most. The 2026 Member Notices represent an opportunity to bridge gaps in awareness and utilization, potentially serving as a catalyst for positive change within the Medicare Advantage 
landscape. By embracing this opportunity, stakeholders can contribute to a more engaged, healthier member population, ultimately enhancing the value and impact of Supplemental Benefits.
