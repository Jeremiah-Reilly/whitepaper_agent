# The Impact of 2026 CMS Member Notices on Supplemental Benefit Utilization in Medicare Advantage

## Introduction

Medicare Advantage (Medicare Part C) offers beneficiaries an alternative to traditional Medicare by providing all Part A and Part B benefits, often with additional **supplemental benefits** like Over-the-Counter (OTC) allowances and transportation services. These benefits enhance member health outcomes and quality of life.

The upcoming **2026 CMS Member Notices** mandate that Medicare Advantage plans inform members about their unused supplemental benefits. While the actuarial community largely expects minimal impact on benefit utilization—assuming that the notices target members with zero utilization—the actual effect may be more substantial. Factors such as benefit accessibility, specific service needs, and eligibility criteria, especially for **Special Supplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill (SSBCI)**, could influence utilization patterns. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for accurate actuarial forecasting and effective plan management.

## Understanding the 2026 CMS Member Notices

### Purpose and Objectives

The **2026 CMS Member Notices** aim to:

- **Increase Awareness**: Inform members about unused Medicare supplemental benefits.
- **Encourage Utilization**: Motivate members to utilize benefits that can improve health outcomes.
- **Ensure Compliance**: Adhere to CMS guidelines promoting beneficiary awareness.

By enhancing transparency and engagement, these notices could alter benefit utilization patterns in Medicare Advantage plans.

## Potential Impact on Supplemental Benefit Utilization

### Over-the-Counter (OTC) Benefits

OTC benefits offer a straightforward process for members to receive health-related products:

- **Easy Ordering**: Members can order online, by phone, or by mail.
- **Home Delivery**: Products are shipped directly to members.

**Increased Awareness** through the 2026 Member Notices could lead to higher utilization, as members become informed about and access these convenient benefits.

### Benefits with Specific Needs

Certain benefits, like **hearing aids** and **transportation services**, cater to members with specific requirements. While the overall impact may be limited, the notices could prompt initial utilization among eligible members who were previously unaware of these services, improving individual health outcomes.

### Special Supplemental Benefits for the Chronically Ill (SSBCI)

SSBCIs provide tailored services for chronically ill members, such as meal deliveries or home modifications. Raising awareness could significantly increase utilization among eligible non-utilizers, enhancing chronic disease management and potentially reducing hospitalizations.

## Implications for Medicare Advantage Plans

### Actuarial Forecasting

- **Reevaluate Assumptions**: Adjust actuarial models to account for potential increases in benefit utilization.
- **Conduct Sensitivity Analyses**: Evaluate financial impacts under varying utilization scenarios.

### Plan Management Strategies

- **Resource Allocation**: Ensure provider networks and supply chains can meet increased demand.
- **Member Engagement**: Utilize proactive communication and digital platforms to support member utilization.

## Conclusion

The **2026 CMS Member Notices** may have a more significant impact on supplemental benefit utilization in Medicare Advantage plans than initially anticipated. Actuaries and plan administrators should proactively address potential changes to maintain financial stability and enhance member satisfaction and health outcomes.
