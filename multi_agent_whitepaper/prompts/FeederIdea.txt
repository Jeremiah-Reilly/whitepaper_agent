    In Medicare Advantage, I'd like to discuss the impact of 2026 Member Notices on Supplemental Benefit Utilization.
    There's a general consensus in the actuarial community that the impact should be negligible because they will only go 
    to members with zero utilization. However, this may not always be the case, but I also don't have a good sense for 
    what the impact may be on non-utilizers. The impact could vary by:
    -Benefit based on ease of use (OTC)
    -Limitations on the need for services (e.g., hearing aids or transportation)
    -Benefit eligibility (SSBCIs)
